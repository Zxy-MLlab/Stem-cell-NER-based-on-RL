Although original strategies focused on the overexpression of a single TF to reprogram cells, it quickly became evident that specific combinations of multiple TFs are needed for efficient reprogramming of most cell types.21,22 As a result, a trial and error approach was adopted where a pool of TFs thought to be important for lineage specification was delivered to cells and then a single TF was removed; if reprogramming efficiency went down, the factor was reinstated but if the efficiency went up or remained unchanged the factor was removed until a minimum combination was achieved.23,24 A transformative success utilizing this approach was the reprogramming of fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) via overexpression of Oct4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4.25 24 different genes associated with maintenance of embryonic stem cell identity were first overexpressed followed by removal of genes until the identification of the four factors needed to generate iPSCs.25 This approach was rapidly adopted within the scientific community and applied to reprogram stromal cells into parenchymal cells of various lineages, including cardiomyocytes,26 neurons,27,28 hepatocytes,29 and pancreatic islet cells.30,31 Additionally, further work built upon this strategy by screening other genetic factors, such as microRNAs and chromatin modification,32\u201335 as well as chemical reprogramming via the addition of cytokines and small molecule inhibitors.36\u201340 While these pioneering studies definitively demonstrated the ability to directly reprogram stromal cells into parenchymal cells, this trial and error approach is limiting in the number of combinations that could be tested, resulting in low reprogramming efficiency.41,42 As such, computational frameworks were developed to predict TF combinations that could directly reprogram one cell type into another.43 While useful, these frameworks are based upon a similar concept of identifying TFs that are differentially expressed between cell types and serve more as a starting point in identifying potential combinations..

Although original strategies focused on the overexpression of a single TF to reprogram cells, it quickly became evident that specific combinations of multiple TFs are needed for efficient reprogramming of most cell types.21,22 As a result, a trial and error approach was adopted where a pool of TFs thought to be important for lineage specification was delivered to cells and then a single TF was removed; if reprogramming efficiency went down, the factor was reinstated but if the efficiency went up or remained unchanged the factor was removed until a minimum combination was achieved.23,24 A transformative success utilizing this approach was the reprogramming of fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) via overexpression of Oct4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4.25 24 different genes associated with maintenance of embryonic stem cell identity were first overexpressed followed by removal of genes until the identification of the four factors needed to generate iPSCs.25 This approach was rapidly adopted within the scientific community and applied to reprogram stromal cells into parenchymal cells of various lineages, including cardiomyocytes,26 neurons,27,28 hepatocytes,29 and pancreatic islet cells.30,31 Additionally, further work built upon this strategy by screening other genetic factors, such as microRNAs and chromatin modification,32\u201335 as well as chemical reprogramming via the addition of cytokines and small molecule inhibitors.36\u201340 While these pioneering studies definitively demonstrated the ability to directly reprogram stromal cells into parenchymal cells, this trial and error approach is limiting in the number of combinations that could be tested, resulting in low reprogramming efficiency.41,42 As such, computational frameworks were developed to predict TF combinations that could directly reprogram one cell type into another.43 While useful, these frameworks are based upon a similar concept of identifying TFs that are differentially expressed between cell types and serve more as a starting point in identifying potential combinations..

Although original strategies focused on the overexpression of a single TF to reprogram cells, it quickly became evident that specific combinations of multiple TFs are needed for efficient reprogramming of most cell types.21,22 As a result, a trial and error approach was adopted where a pool of TFs thought to be important for lineage specification was delivered to cells and then a single TF was removed; if reprogramming efficiency went down, the factor was reinstated but if the efficiency went up or remained unchanged the factor was removed until a minimum combination was achieved.23,24 A transformative success utilizing this approach was the reprogramming of fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) via overexpression of Oct4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4.25 24 different genes associated with maintenance of embryonic stem cell identity were first overexpressed followed by removal of genes until the identification of the four factors needed to generate iPSCs.25 This approach was rapidly adopted within the scientific community and applied to reprogram stromal cells into parenchymal cells of various lineages, including cardiomyocytes,26 neurons,27,28 hepatocytes,29 and pancreatic islet cells.30,31 Additionally, further work built upon this strategy by screening other genetic factors, such as microRNAs and chromatin modification,32\u201335 as well as chemical reprogramming via the addition of cytokines and small molecule inhibitors.36\u201340 While these pioneering studies definitively demonstrated the ability to directly reprogram stromal cells into parenchymal cells, this trial and error approach is limiting in the number of combinations that could be tested, resulting in low reprogramming efficiency.41,42 As such, computational frameworks were developed to predict TF combinations that could directly reprogram one cell type into another.43 While useful, these frameworks are based upon a similar concept of identifying TFs that are differentially expressed between cell types and serve more as a starting point in identifying potential combinations..

Although original strategies focused on the overexpression of a single TF to reprogram cells, it quickly became evident that specific combinations of multiple TFs are needed for efficient reprogramming of most cell types.21,22 As a result, a trial and error approach was adopted where a pool of TFs thought to be important for lineage specification was delivered to cells and then a single TF was removed; if reprogramming efficiency went down, the factor was reinstated but if the efficiency went up or remained unchanged the factor was removed until a minimum combination was achieved.23,24 A transformative success utilizing this approach was the reprogramming of fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) via overexpression of Oct4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4.25 24 different genes associated with maintenance of embryonic stem cell identity were first overexpressed followed by removal of genes until the identification of the four factors needed to generate iPSCs.25 This approach was rapidly adopted within the scientific community and applied to reprogram stromal cells into parenchymal cells of various lineages, including cardiomyocytes,26 neurons,27,28 hepatocytes,29 and pancreatic islet cells.30,31 Additionally, further work built upon this strategy by screening other genetic factors, such as microRNAs and chromatin modification,32\u201335 as well as chemical reprogramming via the addition of cytokines and small molecule inhibitors.36\u201340 While these pioneering studies definitively demonstrated the ability to directly reprogram stromal cells into parenchymal cells, this trial and error approach is limiting in the number of combinations that could be tested, resulting in low reprogramming efficiency.41,42 As such, computational frameworks were developed to predict TF combinations that could directly reprogram one cell type into another.43 While useful, these frameworks are based upon a similar concept of identifying TFs that are differentially expressed between cell types and serve more as a starting point in identifying potential combinations..

Although original strategies focused on the overexpression of a single TF to reprogram cells, it quickly became evident that specific combinations of multiple TFs are needed for efficient reprogramming of most cell types.21,22 As a result, a trial and error approach was adopted where a pool of TFs thought to be important for lineage specification was delivered to cells and then a single TF was removed; if reprogramming efficiency went down, the factor was reinstated but if the efficiency went up or remained unchanged the factor was removed until a minimum combination was achieved.23,24 A transformative success utilizing this approach was the reprogramming of fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) via overexpression of Oct4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4.25 24 different genes associated with maintenance of embryonic stem cell identity were first overexpressed followed by removal of genes until the identification of the four factors needed to generate iPSCs.25 This approach was rapidly adopted within the scientific community and applied to reprogram stromal cells into parenchymal cells of various lineages, including cardiomyocytes,26 neurons,27,28 hepatocytes,29 and pancreatic islet cells.30,31 Additionally, further work built upon this strategy by screening other genetic factors, such as microRNAs and chromatin modification,32\u201335 as well as chemical reprogramming via the addition of cytokines and small molecule inhibitors.36\u201340 While these pioneering studies definitively demonstrated the ability to directly reprogram stromal cells into parenchymal cells, this trial and error approach is limiting in the number of combinations that could be tested, resulting in low reprogramming efficiency.41,42 As such, computational frameworks were developed to predict TF combinations that could directly reprogram one cell type into another.43 While useful, these frameworks are based upon a similar concept of identifying TFs that are differentially expressed between cell types and serve more as a starting point in identifying potential combinations..

Although original strategies focused on the overexpression of a single TF to reprogram cells, it quickly became evident that specific combinations of multiple TFs are needed for efficient reprogramming of most cell types.21,22 As a result, a trial and error approach was adopted where a pool of TFs thought to be important for lineage specification was delivered to cells and then a single TF was removed; if reprogramming efficiency went down, the factor was reinstated but if the efficiency went up or remained unchanged the factor was removed until a minimum combination was achieved.23,24 A transformative success utilizing this approach was the reprogramming of fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) via overexpression of Oct4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4.25 24 different genes associated with maintenance of embryonic stem cell identity were first overexpressed followed by removal of genes until the identification of the four factors needed to generate iPSCs.25 This approach was rapidly adopted within the scientific community and applied to reprogram stromal cells into parenchymal cells of various lineages, including cardiomyocytes,26 neurons,27,28 hepatocytes,29 and pancreatic islet cells.30,31 Additionally, further work built upon this strategy by screening other genetic factors, such as microRNAs and chromatin modification,32\u201335 as well as chemical reprogramming via the addition of cytokines and small molecule inhibitors.36\u201340 While these pioneering studies definitively demonstrated the ability to directly reprogram stromal cells into parenchymal cells, this trial and error approach is limiting in the number of combinations that could be tested, resulting in low reprogramming efficiency.41,42 As such, computational frameworks were developed to predict TF combinations that could directly reprogram one cell type into another.43 While useful, these frameworks are based upon a similar concept of identifying TFs that are differentially expressed between cell types and serve more as a starting point in identifying potential combinations..

{"sentence": "Translation into the clinic is ongoing for various neurological disorders, including: (1) PD, in which nigro-striatal neurons are lost before other neurons, (2) HD, in which MSNs are lost, resulting in striatal atrophy, and (3) glial and myelin disorders.[103,104,105,106] Other disorders, including AD and Lewy body disease, which involve a multitude of neuronal cell types, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy, which are multicentric and diffuse neurodegenerative disorders, remain poor targets for stem cell-based therapies. Glial progenitor cells in the SVZ and the white matter are activated and expanded after ischemia, and this can be further augmented by treatments, including uridine diphosphoglucose glucose, GDNF, epidermal growth factor, EPO, or memantine to differentiate into oligodendrocytes.[149,150] Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in neonates induces cell death in committed neural precursors but stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of immature neural progenitors for brain repairs.[151] Transplantation of stem cells such as UCBMCs might promote the proliferation and neuronal differentiation of endogenous NSCs.
